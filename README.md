# exam_1
Repo for exam 1, covering units 1-4. 

This "exam" is much like our labs, the only difference is that in this lab you will combine the skills you have learned in labs 1 - 3. The previous labs and the class bookdown will be a very valuable resource to you in completing this project. I don't want you spending huge amounts of time on this. In theory you should be able to move through this in an hour or two. If it is taking you longer than that or if you get stuck on something just reach out to me.
